📋 What It Does
When you run this script, it will output the following message to the console:

Code
JavaScript is amazing!
🧠 How It Works
javascript
let myVar = "JavaScript is amazing!";
console.log(myVar);
let myVar = "JavaScript is amazing!"; Declares a variable named myVar and assigns it a string value.

console.log(myVar); Prints the value of myVar to the console.

🛠️ How to Run
Make sure you have a web browser installed (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

Open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).

Go to the Console tab.

Paste the code into the console and press Enter.

Alternatively, you can save the code in an .html file and run it in the browser:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript Console Message</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      let myVar = "JavaScript is amazing!";
      console.log(myVar);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
🎯 Why This Matters
Understanding how to use variables and the console is foundational to learning JavaScript. This project is a great first step toward building interactive web applications.
